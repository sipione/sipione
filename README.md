 Hi, I’m @sipione, I was born in 1995. I started to learn programming in September 2021, why so late? Let me talk a little bit about me and my context.

MY ACADEMIC STEPS:
Cause I’m a Master in law of company and contracts, with focus in compliance program and risk management using non-verbal language and social engineering. Thus, to study all of this a spent a lot of time of my life with an university to the bachelor, an immigration process to make my master degree; and I didn’t say nothing about choose a research area where no one write about :o It’s not easy, I used to publish articles to have someone (me) speaking about my topic and a I use it to my thesis. While I study I always used to work as internship, so I have experiences in the huge companies and small one also. 

MY PAST:
I’m the first person in my family to join in and conclude a bachelor’s degree (also a master), it’s because my family is really poor and I decides to change my reality by the studies, so I get a scholar ship to a preparatory curse and I join in the best high school of the country. After that I get a scholarship in the best law school of the country also, before finishing it I was accepted in the master in Portugal, concluding it in the end of 2021. Nowadays I’m not rich but I lived abroad, I can speak well three languages (English, French, Italian) and know other two (Korean, Russian), beyond my mother language (Portuguese), so I consider myself someone who changed the ordinary life of my relatives.

WHY IT AREA?
I always fall in love for the technology, so this year I decides to change everything and start again a new life. Reborn professionally and academically, cause I really need to do what I love and programming is my beginning. So I got really surprised when I started my studies and find out I really love and quick learn faster than I imagined. I’m loving my evolution day by day, step by step. Started my programing logic with python, so I’m going to learn the basic languages (html, css, js, java, c++, c#, php) and after that, I intend to go deep in python area, cause this language works with everything fascinate me, games and AI.  

All the people has uncountable faces in front of uncountable context in the day by day, but I think I wrote a little bit about me which is important for this social media, thank you to read until here.
