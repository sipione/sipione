## Let me talk a little bit about me and my context.

### CURRENTLY:

Currently working in a educational company with Next js and Node js.

I've been worked as a freelancer building full-stack softwares, complete systems from side to side or a simple website. The work can change a bit considering the clients. The technology I most use in the front-end is React js or Native with their context API, redux, styled components, react-router-dom, that is, i use JavaScript as my main language. To consume the data in the front-end I can use GraphQL or the simple fetch in the REST API routes. To construct the back-end I'm able to use SQL or noSQL databases, such as MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and all this with or without  GRaphQL(I prefer with to avoid under and over fetching). To build the code i use to follow some design patterns, as i like to object oriented programming (POO), follow the SOLID principles, if make sense use Factory Pattern. If make sense aso write the code based in TDD for the tests.

### MY ACADEMIC STEPS:

I’m a Master in law of company and contracts, with focus in compliance program and risk management using non-verbal language and social engineering. I did it in Portugal besides my bachelor degree was in Brazil. In the last period I was approved for the master's degree and started my immigration process to get my master degree. Furthermore I wrote some articles which were published in magazines. In 2021 I decided to start in the It area and here I am until now. 

### WHY IT FIELD?

I always fall in love with technology, so in 2021 I decided to change everything and start a new life. Reborn professionally and academically, cause I really need to do what I love and programming is my beginning. So I was really surprised when I started my studies and found out I really love and learn faster than I imagined. I’m loving my evolution day by day, step by step. Started my programming logic with python, so I’m going to learn the basic languages (html, css, js, java, c#) and after that, I intend to go deeper and deeper. I'm open to all opportunities which can appear on the whole road, but nowadays  would like to reach one of the three points, information security, games or IA,  .  

### MY PAST:

I’m the first person in my family to join in and conclude a bachelor’s degree (also a master), it’s because my family is really poor and I decided to change my reality by the studies, so I get a scholarship to a preparatory curse and I join in the best high school of the country. After that I got a scholarship in the best law school of the country also, before finishing it I was accepted in the master's program in Portugal, concluding it at the end of 2021. Nowadays I’m not rich but I live abroad, I can speak three languages well (English, Spanish, Italian) and know the other two (French, Korean), beyond my mother language (Portuguese), so I consider myself someone who changed the ordinary life of my relatives.
